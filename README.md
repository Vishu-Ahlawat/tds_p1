* To scrape data, I used Python with the requests and pandas libraries for efficient data processing. I accessed the GitHub API to obtain user data seeking help from ChatGPT to get the desired endpoint. To optimize the process, I removed sleep functions and applied basic filtering to refine the dataset.
* An interesting finding was that the language with highest average stars per repository was surprisingly Mermaid, highlighting its popularity and user interest despite not being most commonly used language. This highlights a unique trend in the developer community, emphasizing the importance of visual documentation and diagramming in software projects.
* Developers should consider incorporating visual documentation tools like Mermaid into their projects, as they can enhance user engagement and make complex ideas more accessible, potentially attracting more followers and contributions.
